# Julia Set

Welcome to the Julia Set repository! Explore the fascinating world of fractals and artistic visualization.

## Description

The Julia Set is a set of complex numbers that exhibits fractal-like behavior when iterated using a simple algorithm. Named after the French mathematician Gaston Julia, the Julia Set showcases intricate patterns and self-similar structures.

For more information, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).

## Visual Appeal and Artistic Representation

The Julia Set's fractal nature and intricate details make it visually captivating. Artists and mathematicians alike are drawn to its complexity, using it as inspiration for various forms of artistic expression, including digital art and sculptures.

## Applications

Beyond its aesthetic appeal, the Julia Set has practical applications in various fields, including computer graphics, image compression, and signal processing. Its self-similar structure and infinite complexity make it valuable for generating visually appealing patterns and textures.

## Code

Explore the code used to generate visualizations of the Julia Set. The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries such as matplotlib and numpy.

### Additional Requirements

To run the code and create your own visualizations, you will need:
